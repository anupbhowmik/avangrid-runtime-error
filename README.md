# Avangrid Energy Innovation Hackathon

Team: runtime_error

This repository contains the code and documentation for our submission to the Avangrid Energy Innovation Hackathon. Our project focuses on leveraging data science and machine learning techniques to address challenges in the energy sector.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for analysis and modeling.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the code.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Setup your Python environment (preferably using virtualenv or conda). Python 3.12 is recommended.
1. install the required dependencies:

```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for data analysis and model development.
